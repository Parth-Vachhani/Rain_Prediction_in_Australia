# Rain_Prediction_in_Australia

## Aim:
- To get knowledge about the classification with python problems.
- There were 5 different algorithms in this project.
- Finally the different model were used for checking the accuracy score.

## Dataset:
The original source of the data is Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology and the latest data can be gathered from http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/. The dataset to be used has extra columns like 'RainToday' and our target is 'RainTomorrow', which was gathered from the Rattle at https://bitbucket.org/kayontoga/rattle/src/master/data/weatherAUS.RData
