# Rain_Prediction_in_Australia

## Aim:
- To get knowledge about the classification with python problems.
- There were 5 different algorithms in this project.
- Finally the different model were used for checking the accuracy score.

## Dataset:
The original source of the data is Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology and the latest data can be gathered from http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/. The dataset to be used has extra columns like 'RainToday' and our target is 'RainTomorrow', which was gathered from the Rattle at https://bitbucket.org/kayontoga/rattle/src/master/data/weatherAUS.RData

## Install all librabries:
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib
4. Sklearn
5. LogisticRegression
6. LinearRegression
7. KNeighborsClassifier
8. GridSearchCV
9. train_test_split
10. DecisionTreeClassifier
11. SVC
12. jaccard_score
13. f1_score
14. log_loss
15. confusion_matrix
16. accuracy_score

## Exploratory data analysis:
1. Loading data sets.
2. Find out the shape of the data.
3. Total null value present in the dataset.
4. Check datatypes.
5.
